1) Make possible to save binary files inside the .cpp file
2) Maybe use base85 (you need a decoder in C++, python has a standard once (for encoding)
3) Write an endianess test, you should save endianess of origin machine and find endianess
 of target machine and based on that switch on the method you use to rewrite the binary file on
 the target machine
